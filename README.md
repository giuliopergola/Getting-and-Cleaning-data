# Getting-and-Cleaning-data
This repository includes the files for the final project of Data Science 3 in Coursera

The script analyzes the data available here:

The output is a dataset with the mean and standard deviation of the data collected in the study averaged across each activity and subject.
Before running the script it is necessary to download and unzip the dataset and to modify the first line to direct R to the appropriate folder.
Notice that the dataset includes additional files that are not used in the script, but can be read, if needed, by uncommenting the green lines below (14, 16-18, 37-41).
